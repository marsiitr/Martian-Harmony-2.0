## GUITAR :
Design is highly iterative and innovative process that needs innovation.
### Methodology used :                 
* Identification of need                 
* Definition of problem                 
* Synthesis                                 
* Analysis and Optimization        
* Evaluation
* Presentation
 ### Steps used:
 * Brainstorming session
 * CAD modelling on Solid Works
 * Printing of 3D models on 3D printers
 * Assembling of 3D models<br />
Designing was done in following phases:<br />
Designing part of Robot playing guitar was divided in two parts. While playing a guitar there should be equal control on strings as well as on fret selection. Front part is to be played using sticks and rear part is to be pressed simultaneously.
To achieve the functioning of both parts simultaneously, separate design   should be made. So, design for front part and rear part both should be made.<br />

### FRONT DESIGN:<br />

**First design** (PLA design):<br />

Components used were:<br />
* 1 Ring
* 4 Rectangular shaped structure
* Cubical structure

**Assembly**:<br />
4 rectangular shaped structure bottom parts was attached on the four corners of the ring and their upper part was then attached to the common upper support. Motor was then coupled with that of upper part and it brings the whole mechanism in rotation.
4 guitar playing sticks were attached on four corners of ring which is responsible for plucking of strings.<br />
Reason for rejection:<br />
This design was rejected due to 3D printers. There is a size limit and ring that was used here was exceeding the size.<br />

**Second design** (PLA design):<br />
Components used were:<br />
1. 4 quarters rings<br />
2. 4 rectangular shaped structure<br />
3. Cubical structure<br />

**Assembly**:<br />
4 quarter rings along with four rectangular rods were assembled simultaneously. Upper part of all four rods was then attached to common cubical box /upper support. Motor was then coupled with that of upper part and it brings the whole mechanism in rotation.
4 guitar playing sticks were attached on four corners of ring which is responsible for plucking of strings. Mechanism involved is same; the only difference is in ring part.<br />

Reason for not going for this design:<br />
Despite proper functioning, design was not considered for presentation due to strength factor. PLA made structure was not able to support motor of heavy weight. Less weight motor couldnâ€™t be selected due to its less torque capacity. To achieve rotation of whole structure, sufficient torque is required.<br />
**Third design** (Wood design):<br />
Components used were:<br />
1. 4 straight rectangular structure<br />
2. 4 thin rectangular pieces<br />
3. 1 solid cubical box<br />
4. Motor support(PLA)<br />

**Assembly:**<br />
Assembling of above components is similar to that in above case. Four straight rectangular structures were joined such that they form a square. Thin rectangular pieces are then joined at an angle and finally attached to same solid cubical box. Motor support was also used to make structure free of vibrations.<br />
Reasons for selection of design:<br />
Components made of wood have a sufficient strength. Minimum torque requirement also satisfied
using this design. Less weight and economic consideration is responsible for selecting this design.

### REAR DESIGN :<br />
Rear design is considered for fret selection.<br />
**Mechanism used**:<br />
4 frets were chosen and on each fret there are 6 strings. Appropriate fret and corresponding string selection should be ensured. Using hydraulic principle, strings were pressed. On one side there is a actuator which is responsible for developing pressure and is connected to syringe. Pipe filled with water was connected between two syringes. Pressure developed by actuator on one side of syringe gets transferred to other syringe using hydraulic principle. Pressing of string is to be achieved using this. Actuators are controlled by motors. It is necessary that maximum pressure transfer take place throughout operation. For achieving maximum pressure condition, actuator support was designed using CAD and then printed using 3D printers. For keeping syringe fixed, syringe support was also designed on 3D printers.<br />


**Components used in final design:**<br />
1. Actuator support<br />
2. Syringe support<br />
3. Pipes<br />
4. Actuators<br />
